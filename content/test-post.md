This is a collection of my favourite albums in 2018 and what I’m
looking forward to in 2019. 2018 was a very metalcore year for
me.

### The Almighty Norma Jean

Norma Jean is my mainstay. More often than not I’m spinning them
much more than any new music I find.

Been waiting for this _forever_...

### As Cities Burn
